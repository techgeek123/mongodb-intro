# Create your Own Budget Tracker 

## Release 0
We will build an application that keeps track of a householdâ€™s budget. 

It should do the following:
- The user can add expenses
- The user can also add income 
- Costs and income both can be recurring
- Allow the user to specify a date range and see the net flow of money in and out of the house budget for that time period.
