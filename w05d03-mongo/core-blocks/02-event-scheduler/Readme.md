# Create your Own Calendar

## Release 0 

We're going to build our own calendar app. The app should do the following: 
- User can enter a date and time of an event, event description and then schedule those events on a calendar. 
- User can then browse the calendar or search the calendar for specific events. 


## Release 1 

Think about how can we break this? What does the MVC look like for this app? What kind of tables do we need? Do they need to be related? 
Which routes should we build? How will our pages interact with our routes? What's the flow of the app?


## Release 2: 
Can you allow the application to create re-occurrence events that reoccur every day, week, month, year etc?
